      We are all in this situation together but we WILL pull through! Remember
      those who may be shut-ins, quarantined or seniors who might have
      difficulty getting out. If you are able to, please offer to bring them
      meals, or whatever else they may need, especially over the upcoming
      holiday.
    </p>
    <p class="lead-paragraph">
      We are friends, family, neighbors and a community - everything that makes
      life worth living. With cooperation and common sense this will pass and
      we'll be celebrating together soon.

      Wishing you all peace & good health, The Upper Crust Catering Family
